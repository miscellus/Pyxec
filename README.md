# Pyxec
__Pyxec is a plugin for Sublime Text that lets you execute or evaluate regions of selected python code in your Sublime Text buffer.__

+ If a selection is *evaluated*, it is replaced with the value of the evaluated python expression.
+ If a selection is *executed*, the output of every print statement in the selected code
is written to a special buffer called __"Pyxec View"__

When executing code using Pyxec, the results of assignments and declarations persist; that means that you can use previously defined variables and functions in subsequent executions and evaluations.

Search for Pyxec in Sublime Text's command palette to see the possible commands and default keyboard shortcuts.
